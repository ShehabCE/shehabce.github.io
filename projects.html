  <h2>Lumen | Undergraduate Thesis Project [2016-2017]</h2>
  <span>A two-part driver assistance application - a distraction detector to notify a driver when they aren't focusing on the road, and a navigation display to help them get where they need to go with the least distraction possible. The distraction detector is a <I>pre-trained neural network</I> that monitors the driver through a live video feed. The navigation is a web application that projects directions onto the windshield for the driver to follow.
