  <span
    >A two-part driver assistance application - a distraction detector to notify
    a driver when they aren't focusing on the road, and a navigation display to
    help them get where they need to go with the least distraction possible. The
    distraction detector is a <i>pre-trained neural network</i> deployed on a
    RaspberryPi 3 equipped with a Pi Camera that monitors the driver through a
    live video feed. The navigation is a web application that projects
    directions onto the windshield for the driver to follow.
