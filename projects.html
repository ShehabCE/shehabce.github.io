  <h2>Lumen | Undergraduate Thesis Project [2016-2017]</h1>
  <span>A two-part driver assistance application - a distraction detector to notify a driver when they aren't focusing on the road, and a navigation display to help them get where they need to go with the least distraction possible. The distraction detector is a <I>pre-trained neural network</I> that monitors the driver through a live video feed. The navigation is a web application that projects directions onto the windshield for the driver to follow.

  <span>A peer-to-peer distributed systems that allows users of different machines in the same network to send encrypted images to each other with a view counter and access privileges. Its core functionality is the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Add/Delete/Download/Display embedded Images.</li>
      <li>Grant/Revoke Access to users in the database to view certain images with a set number of views allowed.</li>
      <li>View Downloaded/Allowed-Access Images' list.</li>
