My name is Shehab Abdel-Salam and I'm a software engineer with a passion of building high quality and maintainable software. My passion extends in learning new technologies and recent innovations in the tech world, and I also love to teach!

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Faculty [company]. I previously worked at Dell Technologies for around 2 years both at the Data Office team and Live Optics Product Development team. During my time at Dell, I worked as a part-time graduate teaching assistant at The American University in Cairo [university], and during my undergrad studies I've had couple of internships working as a deep learning researcher and web development intern.

I have a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science and a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from The American University in Cairo [University]. I'm a tech enthusiast who enjoys writing code and writes tech-related posts sharing knowledge whenever I can. 

I am also an experienced C/C++ programmer with a participation history of problem solving competitions such as Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, Codeforces Contests, and Weekly LeetCode Contests.
