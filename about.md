My name is Shehab Abdel-Salam, I'm an AUC fresh grad (Fall 17'), majored in Computer Engineering with a minor in Business Adminstration. I'm a self-taught developer who is always eager to learn about new technologies and recent innovations. I am a passionate writer with a fond of teaching and had some work experience both as a Columnist and as a Teaching Assistant.

I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at The American University in Cairo (Spring 2018-Present) with a goal to develop expertise in both Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 

Since my undergrad journey, I have been working towards enhancing my programming skills through projects, internships, and providing teaching assistance to a variety of undergraduate courses.  

I had a breadth-level of experiences in both technical and non-technical that gave me the opportunity to thrive, learn, and excel. I've worked as a TA (undergrad/grad), Researcher, Project Manager, Columnist, and Software Developer.
