Hello! My name is **Shehab Abdel-Salam**. I'm a Senior Software Engineer with **5+ years** of experience in building new products and solving complex business problems. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on a variety of projects with unique challenges and learning opportunities, sharpening not only my technical skills but also developing my product thinking and leadership skills. You'll find me writing on my [newsletter][newsletter] every week about software engineering and career growth.

I currently work at [Proofpoint][proofpoint], where I play a role in scaling [Tessian][tessian] security products following Proofpoint's acquistion. Previously, I worked at [Faculty AI][company] and was one of the team that built a **Decision Intelligence** product from the ground up called [Frontier][frontier]. Before that, I worked at **Dell Technologies** for 2 years, initially as a backend engineer in the [Live Optics][liveoptics] product development team, and later as a full-stack engineer in the **Data Office** team.

During my grad studies, I had the privilege of teaching programming courses and supporting **over 300** undergraduate students, as well as mentoring aspiring junior engineers in my previous role at Dell. I hold a **M.Sc. degree** in Computer Science and a **B.Sc. degree** in Computer Engineering from [The American University in Cairo][University].

Prior to my professional career, I was an experienced C/C++ programmer and participated in online **problem-solving competitions** such as Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, Codeforces Contests, and Weekly LeetCode Contests.
