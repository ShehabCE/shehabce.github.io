I write a weekly Friday newsletter called **The Proactive Engineer** where I share my thoughts on software engineering, product development, and career growth. I also share some actionable tips for early-mid career engineers and strategies for building a proactive engineering mindset.

(You'll only receive one email per weekâ€”no spam, I promise!)
